# CodeNation_Challenge
This is my solution for CodeNation challenge.

Directory created to enter a solution from Julio CÃ©sar's Cryptography challenge, available from Code Nation.
This challenge is part of the AceleraDev NODE.JS Edition, in Valinhos / SP, supported by the company KROTON.

Explaining the steps:

Description of the Function: caesarCipher.js

Despite the challenge just ask a decryption of a text, i have to create a function that also makes a
encryption. Because of that allows me to reproduce the initial step of an encryption and understand exactly how the second step
work, the decrytion.
So i created a function for encryption (given the rules required by the challenge) and for decryption.
However, i did not provide the encryption function because in this challenge it was not required. If anyone wants access
to this function can contact me by email: detonihenrique@gmail.com. I will be happy to be able to help.

Request for a CodeNation API: api.js

First i used a "request" library to do as necessary requisitions. This gives me access to JSON
returned by the request.
However, i couldn't create a POST method that sent my archive answer.json correctly.
To do this, i used the POSTMAN program, where i could send the solution successfully.

Generating a key hash (cryptographic summary): crypto.js

I have used a library called "crypto", passing the secret message sent by the challenge, having made updated with a message
already decrypted (by my decrypt function). For this process i used the SHA1 algorithm, provided by the library itself.

This challenge was extremely interesting and challenging for me, because i am studying programming in a short time and never had contact
with these technologies, as well i never did created a program for Julio Caesar's Encryption. I worked hard for 2 days to succeed and
be could reach a score of 100%. I'm very pround of this.

Thank you the CodeNation team for the opportunity to participate in this process and test my internal skills and 
on this path to success in computer programming.

Best regards,

Henrique.
